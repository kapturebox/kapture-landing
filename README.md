Ensure you have both [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) installed.


To install Jekyll, run the following command:
```bash
$ gem install jekyll
```

To install Gulp, run the following command:
```bash
$ npm install -g gulp
```

To get started on your local server, run `$ gulp`. BrowserSync will automatically open a browser to `localhost:4000`, watch for changes, and auto reload.
